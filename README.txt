Note: 
The mounted path is /mnt/mta.

There is a script (launcher.sh), that will create the directory if not exist, 
and of course will pull the images from naorb12/linux-assigment3, and run them.
(A server container, and 3 miner containers. Amount can be changed in the script).

There is also a script for cleanup, that will exit and remove the containers.


So please run launcher.sh
